cses - counting paths
Comment
Here is the problem statement: link
You are given a tree consisting of n nodes, and m paths in the tree.
Your task is to calculate for each node the number of paths containing that node.

To solve this, we will need a few techniques. They are discussed below:

Difference array technique
Lets say we are given an array of integers and we have queries of the form : l r x which means add x to all elements of array with indices in range [l,r]. We have several such queries, and after all queries, we wish to find the final array.

Nieve approach:
Perform the addition to all elements in the given range for all queries. Overall complexity:

)

Faster approach:
Let us initially create an array diff of zeroes of size n+2. We assume that l, r are 1-indexed. Now for every query, we do the following: add x to diff[l] and subtract x from diff[r+1] (diff is 0-indexed). After all the queries are over, we take the prefix sum over diff, and what we get is finally the amout that needs to be added to the original array a to obtain the final array after all queries. Let us take an example:

a = [3 5 1 1 6]
queries:
[1 2 1]
[3 5 2]
[5 5 5]

diff = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
query 1:[0 1 0 -1 0 0 0]
query 2:[0 1 0 1 0 0 -2]
query 3:[0 1 0 1 0 5 -7]
prefix sum: [0 1 1 2 2 7 0]
final a: [4 6 3 3 13]

Let us see why this works:
Our aim was to reduce the costs per query, so we typically wanted the per query cost to be

(
1
)
. And after this, we want to process the computation. If we think about a single query, what all is required for updating a range? All we need is to do is add to l, and then this same no. to all nos. from l+1 to r. We know that this is same as doing a prefix sum on an array with all zeroes and a[l] = x. Lets observe:

[0 0 0 0 0 0 0] . query: [1 5 2]
[0 2 2 2 2 2 2]. Now if we just add 2 to l and do a prefix sum, then the (r+1)th value also gets 2. so to cancel the effect of the prefix sum, we subtract 2 form r+1

Now we know that for one query, doing 2 updates and a prefix sum gives us the required diff array. For multiple updates, we can do the 2 updates for all queries and then take the prefix sum at the very end. This works as addition is commutative and associative.
Overall complexity:

The main solution
If we had an array, we would have solved the problem. But what we have is a tree. so things are a little trickier. We somehow want to use the same ideas as that of an array and solve the problem. Key observations:

evey simple path u to v can be broken as u to l and l to v, where l is the lca of u v.
      p
      |  
      l
     / \
    /   k
   u     \
          v
We want to add 1 to the nos. from u to v. So we want to add 1 to the nos. in path u...l and v...k.
In an array, we take prefix sum in the direction of l to r.
So here we have two choices for the direction: l to u and k to v or u to l and v to k.
If we take the latter, then the sum needs to be computed for inner nodes first(starting at leaves). Well, this is easy for us as we have dfs!!
So, all we need to do is a[u]+=1, a[p]-=1, a[v]+=1, a[l]-=1.
Now, as there will be prefix sums coming from the children of a node, this is a classic problem of tree dp.
dp[u] = prefix sum till u. dp[u] = (sum over all child v :(dp[v])) + a[u]. This can easily be computed using a dfs.
